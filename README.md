# Commodity Price Booms and its Impact on Wages
This is a coursework paper I did as an undergrad back in June 2022. It aims to quantify the impact on wages of the commodity super cycle that Chile faced on the mid 2000s.

Codes are available in 3Matching_DiD.R and IO_Linkages.R. The main content of the paper is in 3Matching_DiD.R. There's an additional exercise where I try to measure spillovers on other sectors of the economy using input-output tables which is available on IO_Linkages.R. I have not uploaded the datasets since they are really heavy. But they are publicly available on https://observatorio.ministeriodesarrollosocial.gob.cl/encuesta-casen. I use the biggest household  survey in Chile, Casen, from 2000 until 20015. I also use the CPI and some I-O tables, which are available in this repository.
